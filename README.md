I am a seasoned AI Researcher and Practitioner with over a decade of expertise in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, and their transformative real-world applications. I have a proven track record of bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical implementation, consistently driving efficiency, enhancing decision-making, and solving complex challenges.

I began my AI journey in a small village in southern Iran, overcoming limited resources to rank 344th nationwide in the university entrance exam. This formative experience taught me that there are no limits to what I can achieve, fueling my passion for solving complex problems through AI.

My expertise spans multiple domains, including NLP, Generative AI, and Reinforcement Learning. I have extensive hands-on experience designing and deploying AI systems for various applications, such as RAG pipelines, AIOps solutions, time-series anomaly detection and forecasting, digital health assistants, visual search and recommendation systems, and multi-agent decision-making using deep reinforcement learning and transformers for autonomous vehicles in complex environments. As the CIO/CAIO of Resoniks, I developed and deployed an anomaly detection and quality control solution leveraging AI and acoustics, achieving industry-leading performance.

In academia, I have led groundbreaking research published in leading journals and conferences. My achievements highlight both my research acumen and practical implementation skills:

- MACRPO: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework achieving a significant 82.4% crash reduction in complex traffic scenarios (*Frontiers in Robotics and AI*).
- Multi-Task Representation Learning: An efficient framework enhancing transfer capabilities by 33% in novel environments (*IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles*).
- Vision Transformers for Driving Policies: A pioneering approach reducing crash rates to 5% with half the training data compared to CNN-based models (*IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium*).

My technical skills include Python, C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow, MLOps tools, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. I excel in strategic planning, collaboration, and mentoring, combining technical expertise with a focus on real-world impact.

Outside of work, I mentor aspiring AI professionals and enjoy exploring new ideas. Iâ€™ve written over 90 blog posts on AI, LLMs, and Autonomous Vehicles, making complex topics accessible. My expertise in deploying systems and leading projects sets me apart as an AI leader.
